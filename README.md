# CurvatureCode

The goal of the curvature code is to approximate curvature magnitude at a series of points along a line. 
This line is typically the body of a snake or a soft robot.

There are four main folders:
(1) homography
(2) binarize
(3) centerline
(4) curvature

Folders (1)-(3) are for finding the centerline of the body of interest.
Folder (4) contains code for the actual curvature approximation and plotting/tabulating.

It is very important to update the paths and the loops of folders based on how the data will be saved.
